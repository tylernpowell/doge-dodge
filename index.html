<h2>Doge-Dodge</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Dodge the doges and live for as long as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should be confused but amused.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Casual dodging / side scrolling game
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The game is simple, press left and right arrow to move in those directions and press the spacebar to jump.  Jump over the doges as they run towards you and stay alive for as long as possible.  There is no time limit and no victory besides beating your previous score.  
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Goal is to test difficulty in rather very simple game mechanics.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Right-Left arrow keys to move left and right.  Space bar to jump.  The player gets three lives that cannot be replenished in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
In the middle of nowhere.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This game has no story or plot besides the question, "where did all these doges come from?"
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone is meant to play this game, it's to consume time.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
As long as the player wishes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keep moving and don't try to camp the sides (you will get overrun).  try to run close to the doges moving behind them in the same direction and jump when nearby doges head your way.  Try to stay away from the edges of the room.
